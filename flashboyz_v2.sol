/** DESCRIPTION

    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;: Specifies the Solidity compiler version.

    import "./IERC20.sol";: Importing the ERC20 interface.

    import "./IUniswapV2Router02.sol";: Importing the Uniswap V2 Router interface.

    address private owner;: Private variable to store the contract owner's address.

    IUniswapV2Router02 private uniswapRouter;: Private variable to store the Uniswap Router instance.

    constructor(address _routerAddress) { ... }: Constructor function that initializes the contract owner and the Uniswap Router.

    modifier onlyOwner() { ... }: Modifier that restricts access to only the contract owner.

    function flashLoan(address token, uint256 amount, address dex1, address dex2) external onlyOwner { ... }: Function to perform a flash loan between two DEXs. It takes the token address, loan amount, and addresses of the two DEXs as parameters.

    Inside the flashLoan function, there are comments explaining each step of the flash loan process:
        Getting the token from DEX1.
        Performing arbitrage logic.
        Swapping tokens on DEX2 using the Uniswap Router.
        Repaying the flash loan on DEX1.

Please note that the IERC20 and IUniswapV2Router02 interfaces are assumed to be defined in separate Solidity files and imported into this contract.
