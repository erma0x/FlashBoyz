# FlashBoyzâš¡: Intra-blockchain arbitrage smart contract 

## Description

A flash loan is a type of instant loan available in the context of blockchain-based decentralized finance (DeFi). It is a mechanism that allows users to borrow large amounts of cryptocurrencies without the need to provide collateral or have sufficient capital in their account.

The distinguishing feature of a flash loan is that the loan must be repaid in the same block of transactions in which it is requested. This means that the user must be able to use the loan to execute trades or arbitrage strategies within a single transaction, and then repay the loan amount plus any interest or fees in the same transaction.

The main advantage of a flash loan is that it allows users to temporarily exploit large sums of cryptocurrencies without having to commit their capital. This opens up possibilities for arbitrage and algorithmic trading strategies that may not be possible otherwise.

However, it is important to note that the loan must be repaid in the same transaction. If the loan is not repaid, the entire transaction is canceled and all operations carried out within the transaction are cancelled. This ensures that there is no risk of default or loss for the loan provider.

Flash loans have become popular within the DeFi ecosystem as they allow users to get instant liquidity to execute complex trades without having to have substantial capital. However, they require careful planning and a solid understanding of usage strategies to avoid loss or risk.
